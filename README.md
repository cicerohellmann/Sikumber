# Sikumber
Implementation of Sikulix working with JRuby and Cucumber in Mac OSX 10.10.x version 1.1.0

To run this project you will need Jruby-1.7.18 installed (I recommend you installing it locally, like in a specific folder, using rbenv or rvm) and I'm just sure it runs in Mac OSX 10.10.x (may run in other OS 'cause it's using JRuby)

To set up the environment be sure to have bundler installed:
gem install bundle 
After installing run:
bundle install
This should do the trick,

After that navigte to the project folder and run 
cucumber
And you'll see it testing some stuff in your calculator
